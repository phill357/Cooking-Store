	</center>
	<p>Chris comes from a line of six generations of chefs. Cooking has always been a key part of his families life, and when he first met Christie 
	and tasted her famous sugar creame pie it was love at first taste. They got married and decided to showcase their talents where they first met. 
	They opened up their Cooking Cabin and have been installing the value of cooking and family into the Purdue community ever since.</p>

	<center>
	<p>At Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin has made it their goal to enhance the Lafayette community by not only bringing mouth watering dishes
	to the locals, but by also teaching the community the importance of <b><u>family, tradition, and community.</b></u></p>

	<center>
	<p>Our restuarant is for family ran by a family. Having a five children Chris and Christie know the huge impact family has on one's life. 
	They embrace this family culture and it shows strongly in the resturant.</p>


	<li><p style="font-size:24px;font-family: courier new;color: aliceblue"><b><u>Tradition</u></b></p></li>
	<center>
	<p>Chris comes from a long line of chefs that have inspired him to open up his own resturant. However, is not the only tradition that can be spotted at the Cabin,
	the Cabin also stresses the importance of a nice home cooked meal. This is a tradition that is getting left behind in the ever evolving fast paced world,
	but at the Cabin you can be transported back in time and feel like a little kid again eating a nice cooked meal with your family. </p> 

	<li><p style="font-size:24px;font-family: courier new;color: aliceblue"><b><u>Community</u></b></p></li>

	<p>It is very important for Chris and Christie to give back to the community that has allowed them to pursue their dreams. They are often cooking meals
	and giving out food for those in need. Not only do they serve the community, but it is also very important to the workers at the Cabin to help make
	their resturant as homey and welcoming as possible to those in the community to come together and enjoy a good meal.</p>
